The NBA MVP award (like the MIP award) is selected based on the subjective opinion of broadcasters, announcers, sports journalists, etc. These people each get to cast votes (1st place, 2nd place, and 3rd place votes are all worth a different amount of points, 1st being worth the most) for who they believe is the MVP. The player with the highest share of votes is the winner. The equation for this is as follows:\n","\n","Share = MVP Voting Points / Total Possible MVP Points\n","\n","We want to discover if we can predict the Most Valuable or Improved Player through data analytics, or if there are chapters missing from that story.\n","\n","The data below incorporates many advanced statistics, including play by play information for every player, season wide basic statistics, statistics per 100 possessions, and more. We believe we can use a combination of this data to create a model that can determine the upcoming NBA MVP.\n","\n","**Project Goal:** Our goal is to develop a predictive model that accurately anticipates the next NBA MVP based on a variety of metrics including historical performance data and individual statistics, to uncover the most influential factors contributing to MVP recognition by conducting in-depth analyses of individual and team statistics and to test the model against historical MVP outcomes to assess its performance through cross-validation techniques.\n","\n","**Collaboration Plan**\n","\n","Our plan is to meet once a week, whether it's after class or on Zoom. We have a shared GitHub Page with a project timeline (to be set up) and a shared Google Colab page to work on the project. We will meet to discuss our progress and the direction we are heading, and work on our assigned tasks individually, collaborating with eachother when necessary and keeping eachother informed on our current goal.\n","\n","**Relevant Links:**\n","\n","*NBA Stat FAQ to help identify statistics used and discrepencies in statistics tracked*\n","\n","[FAQ | Stats | NBA.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/help/faq)\n","\n","*The following data is used in Milestone 1*\n","\n","We downloaded the following dataset and its accompanying .csv files to upload to Google Drive for access in our ETL\n","\n","[NBA Stats (1947-Present)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumitrodatta/nba-aba-baa-stats/data)\n","\n","*The following data may be used in Milestone 2 and beyond*\n","\n","\n","[NBA Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wyattowalsh/basketball)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"fDS2OIiRP1Wd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#**Extraction, Transformation, and Loading!**\n","\n","Our project begins with ETL.\n","\n","Below, we are mounting Google Drive, importing libraries, and importing data to be used for Milestone 1.\n","\n","**Mounting Google Drive**\n"],"metadata":{"id":"5hIoONqk0PeQ"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Mounting my google drive for access to the datasets\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Intro to Data Science/Data Science Final Portfolio"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"OPuYMtKO6z82","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1710268282373,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":14068,"user":{"displayName":"Gabriel Epstein","userId":"09414654106876982565"}},"outputId":"26595d3d-91af-4049-8fad-af8be5dd700d"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n","/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/Intro to Data Science/Data Science Final Portfolio\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Importing Libraries:** Below, we are importing some of the libraries we will be using to analyze this data in Jupyter Notebooks.
